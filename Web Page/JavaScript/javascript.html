			<h1>JavaScript</h1>
				<p>
				<strong id="L1">JavaScript:</strong> (JS) is front-end web development: nearly everything you interact with on a website is thanks to this script.
				Before it, sites were static HTML sites with formatting and no interactivity. But JS changed that as the first client-side language.
				It’s used to build the side of the site that the user sees and interacts with.<br>
                JavaScript is a high-level programming language—that means it’s human-readable, flexible, and relatively easier to implement than a
				language like C. However, JavaScript must be compiled to native machine code in order for your computer to read and execute it. Enter
				the JavaScript engine, a process virtual machine designed to interpret, compile, and execute JavaScript code. It’s a big part of the
				speed arms race between browsers, but is also used to power any technology that requires a virtual machine, like Node.js and its role
				in server-side development.<br>
                Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is arguably the most ubiquitous of the client-side scripts. If HTML dictates the content of a page,
				and CSS dictates the look and feel, JavaScript dictates the behavior of a page. JavaScript manipulates both the CSS styles and HTML attributes
				of a page, changing content and the way things look when a user interacts with it.<br>
                JavaScript is technically referred to as “ECMAScript,” and 2015 is the newest version of the ECMAScript standard. This version is a pretty
				significant update to the language—in fact, the first substantial update to the language since it was standardized back in 2009.<br>
				<ul>
                <strong id="L2">Advantages of JavaScript:</strong>
                <li>It’s able to run dynamic sites on anyone’s browser—period. This cross-browser support is made seamless with libraries like jQuery.</li>
				<br>
            	<li>JavaScript works well (and fast) without requiring a lot of memory. Some JavaScript applications can even run without connecting back to a web server,
				which means they’ll work in a browser with or without an internet connection.</li>
				<br>
       	        <li>It moonlights as a server-side programming language via Node.js, a back-end framework that uses JavaScript runtime to build data-intensive
				apps (e.g., anything real-time, like a chat room).</li>
				<br>
               	</li>It’s easy to learn. JavaScript can be learned in a few weeks even though it’s 19 years old. Compared with a language like C++, which can
				take years to learn and has numerous constructs, it’s a quick study.</li>
				<br>
               	<li>It pairs with Karma for excellent testing capabilities. Karma is a JavaScript test runner that runs on Node.js and works well with any
				JavaScript framework. It allows developers to get instant feedback on how the code they’ve written will perform.</li>
				<br>
              	<li>Mobile flexibility: JavaScript has numerous extensions available for responsive mobile app development—including Bootstrap and jQuery
				Mobile. Plus, it’s the basis for React Native, Facebook’s mobile UI framework.</li>
				<br>
              	<li>JavaScript can be compiled from code written in different languages through source-to-source compilers like CoffeeScript. With TypeScript,
				a compiler created by Microsoft, a high-level superset of JavaScript (with the same JS syntax), is compiled into plain JavaScript.</li>
				<br>
	            </ul>
				<ul>
                <strong id="L3">JavaScript Frameworks:</strong>
                JavaScript frameworks streamline more complicated commands into simple blocks of JS code, making programming fast and easy. Here’s a quick
				look at a few of the most popular JS frameworks.<br>
              	<li>jQuery: The most popular JavaScript library out there, it’s the “write less, do more” framework that makes JS behave the same in different
				browsers. Used by sites like IBM and Netflix, it boils down common JS tasks that require many lines of code into one-line bundles.</li><br>
	            <li>AngularJS: Extremely robust, geared toward desktop apps, and perfect for data-heavy sites, the AngularJS framework provides a great
                module-based structure for building complicated applications easily. It’s all about simplification, extending HTML, and using the shortest
				code possible.</li><br>
	            <li>Backbone.js: A lightweight JS framework that’s a pared-down alternative to more full-featured frameworks, it’s all about minimalism.
				Backbone is used by sites like Airbnb and Pinterest.</li><br>
	            <li>Bootstrap: A mobile-first framework, it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to facilitate rapid responsive app development.</li><br>
	            <li>Ember.js: Another lightweight JS framework, Ember has been used by sites like Groupon and Zendesk. It hinges on site performance and
				comes with a built-in data module and template engine. It works particularly well with Ruby on Rails and is the best approach for developers
				familiar with object-oriented programming languages like Ruby, Python, C#, and Java.</li><br>
	            <li>Meteor JS: An open-source, real-time framework, it was built on top of Node.js and works closely with MongoDB, a leading NoSQL open-source
				database.</li><br>
	            <li>Node.js: A server-side development environment designed to use JavaScript to build back-end applications, it has its own slew of frameworks,
				task-runners, and plugins.</li><br>
             	<li>Express.js: This server-side JavaScript framework runs on the Node.js platform.</li><br>
	            <li>Koa.js: This next-generation framework for Node.js follows in Express’ footsteps.</li><br>
	            <li>Prototype: A framework with a built-in API, it makes common JS tasks more streamlined to code.</li><br>
	            <li>MooTools: Another JS framework with an API, it also streamlines common tasks but with a few extras, including effects and animation.</li><br>
                <li>ReactJS: Facebook’s JavaScript library that’s excellent for building web application UIs. React Native is the mobile library for building
				natively rendered mobile application UIs.</li><br>
                <em>Apart from this, JavaScript has “REACT” library designed by Facebook for building user interfaces. Expected Libraries in Java Script 2017 are – D3.JS,
				Node.JS, RIOT.JS, keystone.JS, Chart.VS, etc.  REDUX is the framework that offers transactional, deterministic state management for the
				applications. Amber.JS, VUE.JS, Meteor are few frameworks of JavaScript for 2017.</em>
