			<h1>YouTube</h1>			
				<p>
				<strong id="L1">YouTube</strong> is a video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.
				The service was created by three former PayPal employees. <em>Chad Hurley</em>, <em>Steve Chen</em>, and <em>Jawed Karim</em> in
				February 2005. Google bought the site in November 2006 for $1.65 billion; YouTube now operates as one 
				of Google’s subsidiaries.<br>
                YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add, to favorites, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to other users.
				It offers a wide variety of of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips,
				music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging,
				and educational videos.<br>
                Most of the content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, and Hulu offer some
				of their material via YouTube partnership program.<br>
                <strong id="L2">History:</strong> It was beginning of 2005 when three employees of PayPal, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim,
				they decided start something by their own. Apparently, the story of how it started is a little confusing, since while one of its members
				speaks of a party that took place in San Francisco and the appearance of YouTube as a solution to the problem of sharing the videos recorded
				at the event, another speaks of HotorNot.com influence, dating page, as inspiration to create the idea. That same February 15, 2005 it was
				registered a domain that even they never imagined the success that could only reach a year and a half later. In November 2006, Google would buy
				the platform for the great amount of 1.650 million dollars.<br> 
                <strong id="L3">Success:</strong> YouTube was a unstoppable success since its beginning, with a vertiginous growth. At the end of the year of its
				creation, its videos received 50 million visits daily. A few months later, in May 2006, the portal had 2,000 million daily visits, reaching 7,000
				million in August of the same year. At that time the New York Post estimated that the company had a value of between 600 and 1,000 million dollars.
				In June of 2008, the 38% of videos that were searched in internet belonged to YouTube and the estimated economic benefit of that year Google never
				revealed it, was 200 million dollars. The price of each ad was 175,000, committing the advertiser to spend in addition a minimum of 50,000 dollars
				of advertising on Google.<br>
                <strong id="L4">Operating:</strong> YouTube operating is simple so that any user of the Network can use it without technical knowledge. This is what web 
				2.0 is based on and is the reason for its success, which would otherwise be limited to only user with knowledge and the audience level would be lower.
				Its online player use Adobe Flash or HTML to load its content. This content appears in form of montages of photographs, television cuts, music videos or
				movie clips. The diffusion of its content is based on the ability to insert the videos I blogs or web pages. This allows all pages, personal and corporate,
				to easily add videos to their sites, a fundamental tool for there to be dissemination and YouTube audience has grown to the levels that it has done and keep
				growing. This insertion can be done in two ways, using the corresponding application in blogs like Wordpress, or through HTML code.<br>
                <strong id="L5">Social Impact:</strong> Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences. Independent content creators
				have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort. Celebrities move into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management
				that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial following, and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television. YouTube has enabled
				people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates(2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates
				via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape. YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with
				citizens, the White House’s official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012.<br> 
                <strong id="L6">Revenue:</strong> Google does not provide details for YouTube’s costs, and YouTube’s revenues in 2007 were noted as “not material” in a regulatory filling. In June
				2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at 200 million dollars, noting progress in advertising sales. In January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent
				an average of 15 minutes a day on the site. Its revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion dollars. In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion according to
				eMarketer. In 2017, viewers watch YouTube on mobile devices for more than a hour every day.<br>
				
                <ul>
                <strong id="L7">Censorship and filtering:</strong><br>				
                <em>YouTube may be blocked for a variety of reasons, including:</em>
                <li>•Limiting public exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.</li>
                <li>•Preventing criticism of a ruler.</li>
                <li>•Violations of national laws.</li>
                <li>•Copyright and intellectual property protection laws.</li>
                <li>•Preventing access to videos judged to be inappropriate for youth.</li>
                </ul>
				<ul>
				<strong id="L8">Countries blocked:</strong>				
                In some countries YouTube is completely blocked , either through a long term
				standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest,
				the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In
				other countries access to the website remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked.
				In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree
				to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.<br>
                <em>Several countries have blocked access to YouTube which are:</em>
                <li>•Iran</li>
