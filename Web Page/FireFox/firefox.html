			<h1>FireFox</h1>
				<p>
				<strong id="L1">Mozilla Firefox</strong> is a free and open-source web browser developed by Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla
				Corporation. Firefox is available for Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems. Its sibling, Firefox for Android, is available for Android.
				Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. An additional version,
				Firefox for iOS, was released in late 2015; however, because of artificial restrictions imposed by Apple Inc., it is forced to use the
				platform-bundled WebKit layout engine.<br>
				The Firefox project began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross. They believed the
				commercial requirements of Netscape's sponsorship and developer-driven feature creep compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser. 
				To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a stand-alone browser, with which they intended to replace
				the Mozilla Suite. On April 3, 2003, the Mozilla Organization announced that they planned to change their focus from the Mozilla Suite
				to Firefox and Thunderbird. The community-driven SeaMonkey was formed and eventually replaced the Mozilla Application Suite in 2005.<br>
				The Firefox project has undergone several name changes. It was originally titled Phoenix, which carried the implication of the mythical
				firebird that rose triumphantly from the ashes of its dead predecessor, in this case from the "ashes" of Netscape Navigator after it had
				been killed off by Microsoft Internet Explorer in the "First browser war". Phoenix was renamed due to trademark issues with Phoenix 
				Technologies; the replacement name, Firebird, provoked an intense response from the Firebird database software project. In response,
				the Mozilla Foundation stated that the browser would always bear the name Mozilla Firebird to avoid confusion. After further pressure,
				on February 9, 2004, Mozilla Firebird became Mozilla Firefox. The name Firefox was said to be derived from a nickname of the red panda,
				which became the mascot for the newly named project. For the abbreviation of Firefox, Mozilla prefers Fx or fx, though it is often abbreviated
				as FF. The Firefox project went through many versions before the version 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004.<br>
				In 2016, Mozilla announced a project known as Quantum, which sought to improve Firefox's Gecko engine and other components in order to 
				improve Firefox's performance, modernize its architecture, and transition the browser to a multi-process model. These improvements came
				in the wake of decreasing market share to Google Chrome, as well as concerns that its performance was lapsing in comparison. Despite its
				improvements, these changes required existing add-ons for Firefox to be made incompatible with newer versions, in favor of a new extension
				system that is designed to be similar to Chrome and other recent browsers. Firefox 57, which was released in November 2017, was the first 
				version to contain enhancements from Quantum, and has thus been named Firefox Quantum. A Mozilla executive stated that Quantum was the
				"biggest update" to the browser since version 1.0.<br>
				<strong id="L2">Features:</strong> Include tabbed browsing, spell checking, incremental find, live bookmarking, Smart Bookmarks, a 
				download manager, private browsing, location-aware browsing (also known as "geolocation") based on a Google service, and an integrated
				search system, which uses Google by default in most markets. Additionally, Firefox provides an environment for web developers in which
				they can use built-in tools, such as the Error Console or the DOM Inspector, or extensions, such as Firebug and more recently there has been an integration
				feature with Pocket.<br>
				Functions can be added through add-ons created by third-party developers. Add-ons are primarily coded using an HTML and JavaScript API
				known as WebExtensions, which is designed to be similar to the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension systems. Firefox previously 
				supported add-ons using the XUL and XPCOM APIs, which allowed them to directly access and manipulate much of the browser's internal 
				functionality. As they are not compatible with its multi-process architecture, XUL add-ons are now deemed Legacy add-ons and are no 
				longer supported on Firefox 57 and newer.<br>
				Firefox can have themes added to it, which users can create or download from third parties to change the appearance of the browser.
				The Firefox add-on website also gives users the ability to add other applications such as games, ad-blockers, screenshot apps, and many
				other apps.<br>
				Firefox implements many web standards, including HTML4 (almost full HTML5), XML, XHTML, MathML, SVG 2 (partial), CSS (with extensions),
				ECMAScript (JavaScript), DOM, XSLT, XPath, and APNG (Animated PNG) images with alpha transparency. Firefox also implements standards proposals
				created by the WHATWG such as client-side storage, and canvas element. These standards are implemented through the Gecko layout engine, and
				Spidermonkey JavaScript engine.<br>
				Firefox also implements a proprietary protocol from Google called "Safe Browsing", used to exchange data related with phishing and malware
				protection.<br>
				The desktop version of Firefox is available and supported for Windows, macOS and Linux, while Firefox for Android is available for Android
				(formerly Firefox for mobile, it also ran on Firefox OS).<br>
				<strong id="L3">Microsoft Windows:</strong>
				Firefox 1.0 was released for Windows 9x, as well as Windows NT 4.0 and later. Some users reported the 1.x builds were operable 
				(but not installable) on Windows NT 3.51.<br>
				Version 43.0 included the first x64 builds, made for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2. Version 49.0 dropped support for processors without 
				the SSE2 instruction set on Windows.<br>
				In 2017, users of Firefox 52.0.2 on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 who had automatic updates enabled, were migrated to
				Firefox 52 ESR. The support is projected to end for these operating systems with the last release in 2018.<br>
				In September 2013, a Metro-style version of Firefox optimized for touchscreen use was introduced on the "Aurora" release channel. However,
				the project has since been cancelled as of March 2014, with Mozilla citing a lack of user adoption of the beta versions.<br>
				<strong id="L4">macOS:</strong>
				The first official release (Firefox version 1.0) supported macOS (then called Mac OS X) on the PowerPC architecture. Mac OS X builds for
				the IA-32 architecture became available via a universal binary which debuted with Firefox 1.5.0.2 in 2006.<br>
				Starting with version 4.0, Firefox was released for the x64 architecture to which macOS had migrated to.<br>
				<strong id="L5">Linux:</strong>
				Since its inception, Firefox for Linux supported the 32-bit memory architecture of the IA-32 instruction set. 64-bit builds were introduced
				in the 4.0 release.The 46.0 release replaced GTK+ 2.18 with 3.4 as a system requirement on Linux and other systems running X.Org.
				Starting with 53.0. the 32-bit builds require the SSE2 instruction set.<br>
				<strong id="L6">Firefox for mobile:</strong>
				Firefox for Android, code-named Fennec, is a web browser for smaller non-PC devices, mobile phones, and PDAs. It was originally first
				released for the Nokia Maemo operating system, specifically the Nokia N900, on January 28, 2010. On March 29, 2011, besides Maemo,
				Version 4 was added for Android. With the release of mobile version, the browser's version number was bumped from 2 to 4, synchronizing
				it with all future desktop releases of Firefox because the rendering engines used in both browsers are the same. Version 7 was the last
				release for Maemo on the N900.<br>
				Firefox source code is free software, with most of it being released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 2.0. This license
				permits anyone to view, modify, or redistribute the source code. As a result, several publicly released applications have been built
				from it, such as Netscape, Flock, Miro, GNU IceCat, Iceweasel, Songbird, Pale Moon, and Comodo IceDragon.<br>
				Besides official releases, Mozilla provides development builds of Firefox in distribution channels named, in order of most to least stable,
				"Beta", "Developer Edition" (former "Aurora", renamed on November 10, 2014), and "Nightly". As of January 23, 2018, Firefox 59 is in the
				"Beta" and "Developer Edition" channel, and Firefox 60 is in the "Nightly" channel. Starting from Firefox 54, "Developer Edition" is based
				on the "Beta" build.<br>
				Firefox Extended Support Release, abbreviated to ESR, is a version of Firefox for organizations and other groups that need extended support
				for mass deployments. Each ESR release, based on the regular version released at the same time, is supported for approximately one year. 
				Unlike the regular ("rapid") releases, ESRs are not updated with new features and performance enhancements every six weeks, but rather are
				updated with only high-risk-reduction or high-impact security fixes or major stability fixes with point releases, until the end of the ESR
				cycle.
