			<h1>Welcome</h1>

				<strong id="L1">Microsoft Edge:</strong> Is a web browser developed by Microsoft and included in Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile and Xbox One,
				replacing Internet Explorer as the default web browser on all device classes. According to Microsoft, it is designed to be a lightweight web
				browser with a layout engine built around web standards. It has new features, including integration with Cortana, annotation tools, and a 
				reading mode.<br>
				Edge does not support ActiveX or Browser Helper Objects of Internet Explorer. Browser extension support was developed and added in preview
				builds in March 2016, and released with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update on August 2, 2016. Microsoft Edge extensions are distributed via
				Microsoft Store.<br>
				On October 5, 2017, Microsoft announced a preview of Microsoft Edge for Android and iOS. The apps exited the "preview" stage on November 30
				, 2017.<br>
				<strong id="L2">Features</strong>
				Microsoft Edge is the default web browser on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, and Xbox One consoles, replacing Internet Explorer 11 
				and Internet Explorer Mobile. Microsoft initially announced that Edge would support the legacy Trident (MSHTML) layout engine for
				backwards compatibility, but later said that, due to "strong feedback", Edge would use a new engine, while Internet Explorer would 
				continue to provide the legacy engine.<br>
				Favorites, reading list, browsing history and downloads are viewed at the Hub, a sidebar providing functionality similar to
				Internet Explorer’s Downloads manager and Favorites Center.<br>
				The browser includes an integrated Adobe Flash Player and a PDF reader. It also supports asm.js.<br>
				Edge does not support legacy technologies such as ActiveX and Browser Helper Objects, and will instead use an extension system.
				Internet Explorer 11 will remain available alongside Edge on Windows 10 for compatibility; it will remain nearly identical to
				the Windows 8.1 version and not use the Edge engine as was previously announced.<br>
				<strong id="L3">EdgeHtml</strong>
				EdgeHTML is a proprietary layout engine developed for Edge. It is a fork of Trident that has removed all legacy code of older 
				versions of Internet Explorer and rewritten the majority of its source code to support web standards and interoperability with
				other modern browsers. EdgeHTML is written in C++.The rendering engine was first released as an experimental option in Internet
				Explorer 11 as part of the Windows 10 Preview 9926 build.<br>
				EdgeHTML is meant to be fully compatible with the WebKit layout engine used by Safari, Chrome and other browsers. Microsoft has
				stated that "any Edge-WebKit differences are bugs that we’re interested in fixing."<br>
				A review of the engine in the beta Windows 10 build by AnandTech found substantial benchmark improvements over Trident; particularly
				JavaScript engine performance, which had come up to par with that of Google Chrome.[26] Other benchmarks focusing on the performance 
				of the WebGL API found EdgeHTML to perform much better than Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.<br>			
				<strong id="L4">Development</strong>
				In December 2014, writing for ZDNet, technology writer Mary Jo Foley reported that Microsoft was developing a new web browser codenamed "Spartan"
				for Windows 10. She said that "Spartan" would be treated as a new product separate from Internet Explorer, with Internet Explorer 11 retained
				alongside it for compatibility.<br>
				In early January 2015 The Verge obtained further details surrounding "Spartan" from sources close to Microsoft, including reports that it would
				replace Internet Explorer on both the desktop and mobile versions of Windows 10. Microsoft officially unveiled "Spartan" during a
				Windows 10-focused keynote on January 21, 2015. It was described as a separate product from Internet Explorer; its final name was not 
				announced.<br>
				On April 29, 2015, during the Build Conference keynote, it was announced that "Spartan" would officially be known as Microsoft Edge. 
				The browser's logo and branding was designed to maintain continuity with the branding of Internet Explorer. The Project "Spartan" 
				branding was used in versions released after Build 2015. On June 25, Microsoft released version 19.10149 for Windows 10 Mobile which
				included the new brand. On June 28, version 20.10158 followed for the desktop versions, also including the updated branding. 
				On July 15, Microsoft released version 20.10240 as the final release to Insiders.
				The same version was rolled out to consumers on July 29.<br>
				On October 5, 2017, Joe Belfiore announced that Microsoft was working on a version of Edge for Android and iOS. A feature-limited beta
				version for iOS was also made available but the Android version, at the time of the announcement, was not available. According to Mary
				Jo Foley, these versions are not a full port of Microsoft Edge, but just its look and feel; Edge would not use the EdgeHTML layout
				engine, but rather the iOS's Webkit and the Android's Blink engine.<br>
				<strong id="L5">Performance</strong>
				In July 2015, Edge scored 377 out of 555 points on the HTML5test. Chrome 44 and Firefox 42 scored 479 and 434 respectively,
				while Internet Explorer 11 scored 312.<br>
				In August 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 Build 10532 to insiders, which included Edge 21.10532.0. This beta version scored 445 
				out of 555 points on the HTML5test.<br>
				With the release of Windows 10 Build 14390 to insiders in July 2016, the HTML5test score of the browser's development version was 460
				out of 555 points. Chrome 51 scored 497, Firefox 47 scored 456, and Safari 9.1 scored 370.<br>
				<strong id="L6">Power Efficiency</strong>
				In June 2016, Microsoft published benchmark results to prove superior power efficiency of Edge in comparison to all other major web browsers. 
				Opera questioned the accuracy and provided their own test results where Opera came out on top. Independent testing by PC World confirmed Microsoft's
				results. However, tests conducted by Linus Sebastian contradicted Microsoft's results, instead showing that Chrome has the best battery 
				performance.<br>
