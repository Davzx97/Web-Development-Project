			<h1>Conversational UI</h1>				
				<p>
				 <strong id="L1">Conversational UI</strong> gives the privilege of interacting with the computer on human terms. It is a paradigm
				 shift from the earlier communications achieved either by entering syntax-specific commands or clicking icons.
				 Conversational interface allows a user to tell the computer what to do. Conversational UI is more social in the
				 way the user <q>“contacts”</q>, <q>“invites”</q> and “messages” than the traditional apps that are technological in nature where
				 the user downloads and installs.<br>
                 <strong id="L2">Conversational Interface:</strong> In some ways it returns to the simplicity of the command line, in that it is primarily a
				 text-based medium. But it differs in that rather than requiring the user to know exact commands, it offers the ability for the user to interact
				 with a machine (or a person behind a machine) using natural language.<br>   
                 Websites are starting to jump on the UI trend of conversational interfaces. First websites, designed with a <q>“conversation first”</q> approach
				 already pop up and seem to become increasingly popular.<br>
	             <strong id="L3">Browsing &amp; Navigation to be Replaced with Conversation:</strong>
                 When you develop an e-commerce website inclusive of a good navigation structure; the search tab and other stuff to make sure that customers don't
				 find it difficult to reach the product they desire. Now, what happens when you replace all those elements with a bot?<br>
                 For customers, it will be as similar to visiting a shop in person, where he will find a salesperson to guide him to the actual product. The bot will
				 carry out human-like conversation giving you personalized shopping experience. For customers, it is a real-time experience.<br>
               	 <strong id="L4">Understanding Natural Language Processing &amp; AI Principles:</strong>
                 Website developers should start looking beyond the conventional backend programming languages and start getting familiar with machine learning and NLP.
                 Developers should know that their future lies in these natural language processing algorithms. The technology is all about learning the patterns and performing
				 tokenization, entity recognition, normalization, speech tagging, dependency parsing, and intent and sentiment analysis for designing an intelligent chatbot for
				 the website.<br> 
                 <strong id="L5">Developing Conversational UI:</strong>
                 Webs developers have some real challenge here. From avoiding conventional graphic elements to designing a bot that speaks human language, they have a lot to learn
				 and implement to give novice users an option to have a human talk with bots and have an exceptional online experience.<br>
               	 <strong id="L6">Integration with best Bot Development Frameworks:</strong>
                 For web-based chatbot, currently, there is Microsoft bot framework, Wit.ai, API.ai, and Aspect CXP-NLU. A bot development framework basically consists of a Bot Builder
				 SDK, Bot Connector, Developer Portal, and Bot Directory. Web developers should look for a framework that is event-based, flexible and built on proven technologies to overcome
				 shortcomings that are basically found in bot development platforms.Bots are designed to make our life less simple and they are interesting from several standpoints and use
				 cases. Since the language of computers and human beings are different, tech people depend on graphical user interfaces to make interaction possible. However, these user
				 interfaces come with a natural barrier- people have to acquire skills to use them. Virtual assistants that reside inside the chat apps could assist us shop online, do banking,
				 or arrange a trip- all powered by chat.
