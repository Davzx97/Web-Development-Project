			<h1>Facebook</h1>
				<p>
				<strong id="L1">Facebook</strong> is an online social media and social networking service.
				The Facebook as it was known at the beginning was release on February 
				4, 2004, by <em>Mark Zuckerberg</em>, along with fellow Harvard College students 
				and roommates, <em>Eduardo Saverin</em>, <em>Andrew McCollum</em>, <em>Dustin Moskovitz</em>, and 
				<em>Chris Hughes</em>.<br> 
                In the beginning founders had limited the website’s membership only to 
				Harvard students. Later the website was expanded to higher educational 
				institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools and Stanford University.
				Facebook added support for various other universities, and eventually to high school
				students as well. Since 2006, anyone who be at least 13 years old has been allowed to 
				become a registered user. Although variations exist in the minimum of age depending on
				applicable local laws.<br>
                Facebook may be accessed by a large range of devices with Internet connection, such as 
				desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones. After registering users can set up a customized
				profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users
				as friends, exchanges messages, post status updates, share photos and links. Users who have the same
				interests can create groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics.<br>   
                <strong id="L2">History:</strong>  Zuckerberg wrote a program called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending to Harvard University
				as a second-year student. According to The Harvard Crimson, the web site was comparable to Hot or Not.
				Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online. The Facemash site
				was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard
				administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged y the administration with breach of security, violating
				copyrights and individual privacy. Ultimately the charges were dropped.<br>
                A “face book” is a student directory featuring photos and basic information. In 2003, there were no universal online
				facebooks at Harvard, with only paper sheets distributed and private online directories. In January 2004, Zuckerberg 
				began writing code for a new website, known as “The Facebook”, with the inspiration coming from an editorial in the in
				the Crimson about Facemash. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched “The Facebook”, originally located at thefacebook.com.
				Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss together with Divya Narendra  accused Zuckerberg
				of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com. They claimed
				that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. They later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling
				in 2008 for 1.2 million shares.<br>				
                Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College; within the first month, more than half the undergraduates at Harvard
				were registered on the service. Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the
				growth of the website. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to the universities of Columbia, Stanford, and Yale. It later opened to all Ivy League
				colleges, Boston University, New York University, MIT, and gradually most universities in the United States and Canada. In June 2004, Facebook
				moved its operations base to Palo Alto, California and it received its first investment later that month from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. In 2005,
				the company dropped “the” from its name after purchasing the domain name facebook.com for $200,000. The domain facebook.com belonged to AboutFace Corporation
				before the purchase. This website last appeared on April 8, 2005; from April 10, 2005 to August 4, 2005, this domain gave a 403 error. In May 2005, Acces Partners
				invested $12.7 million in Facebook and Jim Breyer added $1 million of his own money. In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages. These started as group pages,
				but a new concept called company pages was planned. Pages began rolling out for businesses in May 2009. On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a
				1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion. Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements
				on the social networking site. In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Almost a year later, in September 2009,
				Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time. A January 2009 study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.
				Facebook increased steadily after 2009. The company announced 500 million users in July 2010. Facebook's value was $41 billion. The company had slightly surpassed eBay to become the third
				largest American web company after Google and Amazon. In early 2011, Facebook announced plans to move its headquarters to the former Sun Microsystems campus in Menlo Park, California. In March
				2011, it was reported that Facebook was removing approximately 20,000 profiles every day for violations such as spam, graphic content, and underage use. Facebook had in 2011 become the second-most accessed
				website in the U.S. behind Google. Zuckerberg announced to the media at the start of October 2012 that Facebook had passed the monthly active users mark of one billion. The company's data also revealed 600
				million mobile users, 219 billion photo uploads, and 140 billion friend connections. On January 17, 2017, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg planning to open Station F, a startup incubator campus in Paris, France.
				On a six-monthly cycle, Facebook will work with ten to 15 data-driven startups in the location to help them develop their businesses. On October 16, 2017, Facebook acquired the anonymous compliment social media
				app tbh for an undisclosed amount, announcing intentions to leave the app independent, similar to Instagram and WhatsApp.
				Its current headquarters is in Menlo Park, California, U.S.<br>
                <strong id="L3">Awards and recognition:</strong> The website has won awards such as placement into the “Top 100 Classic Websites” by Pc Magazine in 2007 and winning the “People’s Voice Award” from Webby Awards in 2008. In a 2006 study
				conducted by Student Monitor, a company specializing in research concerning the college student market, Facebook was named second most popular thing among undergraduates.  In 2010, Facebook won the Crunchie "Best
				Overall Startup Or Product" award for the third year in a row.<br>

				leaders to meet Facebook’s top executives at an influencer’s summit in February 2010. Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for True Blood, American Idol, and Top Gear.<br>
