			<h1>Chrome</h1>
				<p>
				<strong id="L1">Google Chrome:</strong> is a freeware web browser developed by Google. It was first released in September 2008, for Microsoft Windows,
				and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS and Android. Google Chrome is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as a platform for running
				web apps.<br>
                Google releases the majority of Chrome's source code as the Chromium open-source project. One component that is not open-source is the built-in Adobe
				Flash Player (that Chrome has disabled by default since September 2016). Chrome used the WebKit layout engine until version 27. As of version 28, all Chrome
				ports except the iOS port use Blink, a fork of the WebKit engine.<br>
                As of 2018, StatCounter estimates that Google Chrome has a 66% worldwide usage share of web browsers as a desktop browser. It also has 56% market share across
				all platforms combined, because it has over 50% share on smartphones. Its success has led to Google expanding the "Chrome" brand name on various other products
				such as Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox and Chromebase.<br>
                Google CEO Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company," and he did
				not want to go through "bruising browser wars." After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of
				Chrome, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."<br>
                Rumors of Google building a web browser first appeared in September 2004. Online journals and U.S. newspapers stated at the time that Google was hiring former Microsoft
				web developers among others. It also came shortly after the final 1.0 release of Mozilla Firefox, which was surging in popularity and taking market share from Internet
				Explorer, which was suffering from major security problems.<br>
                The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features
				within the new browser. Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and German blogger Philipp Lenssen of Google Blogoscoped made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic 
				available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008. Google subsequently made the comic available on Google Books and mentioned it on their official blog
				along with an explanation for the early release. The product was allegedly named "Chrome" because Google wanted to minimize the chrome of the browser, though this meaning
				was added somewhat post-hoc, the 'codename' before release apparently chosen from a connotation of speed.<br>
                The browser was first publicly released on September 2, 2008 for Windows XP and later, with 43 supported languages, officially a beta version, and as a stable public release
				on December 11, 2008.<br>
                On the same day, a CNET news item drew attention to a passage in the Terms of Service statement for the initial beta release, which seemed to grant to Google a license to all
				content transferred via the Chrome browser. This passage was inherited from the general Google terms of service. Google responded to this criticism immediately by stating that
				the language used was borrowed from other products, and removed this passage from the Terms of Service.<br>
                Chrome quickly gained about 1% usage share. After the initial surge, usage share dropped until it hit a low of 0.69% in October 2008. It then started rising
				again and by December 2008, Chrome again passed the 1% threshold.<br>
                In early January 2009, CNET reported that Google planned to release versions of Chrome for OS X and Linux in the first half of the year.
				The first official Chrome OS X and Linux developer previews were announced on June 4, 2009, with a blog post saying they were missing many
				features and were intended for early feedback rather than general use.<br>
                In December 2009, Google released beta versions of Chrome for OS X and Linux. Google Chrome 5.0, announced on May 25, 2010, was the first
				stable release to support all three platforms.<br>
                Chrome was one of the twelve browsers offered to European Economic Area users of Microsoft Windows in 2010. Chrome was assembled from 25
				different code libraries from Google and third parties such as Mozilla's Netscape Portable Runtime, Network Security Services, NPAPI
				(dropped as of version 45), Skia Graphics Engine, SQLite, and a number of other open-source projects. The V8 JavaScript virtual machine
				was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was Adobe/Mozilla's Tamarin) and handled by a separate team in Denmark
				coordinated by Lars Bak at Aarhus. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance
				and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but web applications such as Gmail "are using the web browser to the fullest when
				it comes to DOM manipulations and JavaScript", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.<br>
               <strong id="L2">Chrome features:</strong> a minimalistic user interface, with its user-interface principles later being implemented into
			    other browsers. For example, the merging of the address bar and search bar into the omnibox. Chrome also has a reputation for strong browser
			    performance.<br>
				Chrome allows users to synchronize their bookmarks, history, and settings across all devices with the browser installed by sending and 
				receiving data through a chosen Google Account, which in turn updates all signed-in instances of Chrome. This can be authenticated either
				through Google credentials, or a sync passphrase.<br>
				The first release of Google Chrome passed both the Acid1 and Acid2 tests. Beginning with version 4.0, Chrome has passed all aspects of
				the Acid3 test.<br>
			    As of May 2011, Chrome has very good support for JavaScript/ECMAScript according to Ecma International's ECMAScript standards conformance 
				Test 262 (version ES5.1 May 18, 2012). This test reports as the final score the number of tests a browser failed; hence lower scores are 
				better. In this test, Chrome version 37 scored 10 failed/11578 passed. For comparison, Firefox 19 scored 193 failed/11752 passed and
				Internet Explorer 9 has a score of 600+ failed, while Internet Explorer 10 has a score of 7 failed.<br>

				<ul>
                <strong id="L3">Chrome runs on:</strong>
               	<li>Windows 7 or later</li>
				<br>
				<li>OS X 10.9 or later</li>
				<br>
				<li>64-bit versions of Ubuntu 14.04+, Debian 8+, openSUSE 13.3+ and Fedora 24+</li>
				<br>
				<li>Android 4.1 or later</li>
				<br>
				<li>iOS 10 or later</li>
				<br>
				</ul>
				<p>
				<strong id="L4">Notable features:</strong> synchronization with desktop Chrome to provide the same bookmarks and view the same browser tabs,
				page pre-rendering, hardware acceleration.<br>
                <strong id="L5">Many of the latest HTML5 features:</strong> almost all of the Web Platform's features: GPU-accelerated canvas, including CSS
				3D Transforms, CSS animations, SVG, WebSocket (including binary messages), Dedicated Workers; it has overflow scroll support, strong HTML5
				video support, and new capabilities such as IndexedDB, WebWorkers, Application Cache and the File APIs, date- and time-pickers, parts of
				the Media Capture API. Also supports mobile oriented features such as Device Orientation and Geolocation.<br>
                <strong id="L6">Mobile customizations:</strong> swipe gesture tab switching, link preview allows zooming in on (multiple) links to ensure the
				desired one is clicked, font size boosting to ensure readability regardless of the zoom level.<br>
                <em>Features missing in the mobile version include sandboxed tabs, Safe Browsing, apps or extensions, Adobe Flash (now and in future),
				Native Client.</em><br>
				<strong id="L7">Chrome OS:</strong>
				Google Chrome is the basis of Google's Chrome OS operating system that ships on specific hardware from Google's manufacturing partners.
				The user interface has a minimalist design resembling the Google Chrome browser. Chrome OS is aimed at users who spend most of their computer
				time on the Web; the only applications on the devices are a browser incorporating a media player and a file manager.<br>
				<strong id="L8">iOS:</strong>
				Chrome is available on Apple's mobile iOS operating system as Google Chrome for iOS. Released in the Apple App Store on June 26, 2012,
				it supports the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, and requires that the device has iOS 9.0 or greater installed. In accordance with Apple's
				requirements for browsers released through their App Store, this version of Chrome uses the iOS WebKit – which is Apple's own mobile rendering
				engine and components, developed for their Safari browser – therefore it is restricted from using Google's own V8 JavaScript engine. Chrome is
				the default web browser for the iOS Gmail application, but it cannot be used as the device-wide default application for opening webpages
				because Apple has not provided iOS users with the option to change the default from Safari.<br>
				<strong id="L9">Linux:</strong>
				On Linux distributions, support for 32-bit Intel processors ended in March 2016. As of Chrome version 26, Linux installations of the browser
				may be updated only on systems that support GCC v4.6 and GTK v2.24 or later. Thus deprecated systems include (for example) Debian 6's 2.20,
				and RHEL 6's 2.18.<br>
				<strong id="L10">Windows:</strong>
				Support for Google Chrome on Windows XP and Windows Vista has ended as of April 2016. The last release of Google Chrome that can be run on
				Windows XP and Windows Vista was version 49.0.2623.112 m, released on April 7, 2016, then re-released on April 11, 2016.<br> 
				In June 2012, the now discontinued "Windows 8 mode" was introduced to developer channel, which enables Windows 8 and 8.1 users to run
				Chrome with a full-screen, tablet-optimized interface, with access to snapping, sharing, and search functionalities. In October 2013,
				Windows 8 mode on developer channel changed to use a desktop environment mimicking the interface of Chrome OS with a dedicated windowing
				system and taskbar for web app. This was discontinued as of version 49 and users that have upgraded
				to Windows 10 will lose this feature.<br> 
				<strong id="L11">macOS:</strong>
				Google dropped support for Mac OS X 10.5 after the release of Chrome 21. Support for 32-bit versions of Chrome ended in October 2014,
				with Chrome 38 being the last supported 32-bit version. Support for Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 ended in April 2016 with the release
				of Chrome 50.<br>
